# Knowledge Base

424 files across 9 domains. Accumulated primarily from agent-planned and -executed research programs (2026-03-18 through 2026-03-21). Trust: 35 high, 314 medium, 70 low. Most content has been promoted from `_unverified/` and reviewed. Agent-generated self-knowledge syntheses now live in `self/` with medium trust instead of the external-research quarantine.

## Thematic threads across domains

**Intelligence as dynamical regime.** The central intellectual thread. Converges from dynamical systems theory (mathematics), free energy principle (philosophy), relevance realization (cognitive science), and scaling laws (ai). Start with [philosophy/synthesis-intelligence-as-dynamical-regime.md](philosophy/synthesis-intelligence-as-dynamical-regime.md).

**Memory and persistence.** How biological memory works (cognitive-science/memory/), how it maps onto this system's architecture (cognitive-science/cognitive-science-synthesis.md), and the security implications of persistent memory (self/security/). The reconsolidation research is directly design-relevant.

**Memetic security.** 7 files under [self/security/](self/security/) analyzing injection vectors, drift vs. attack, trust escalation, and the irreducible limits of self-referential governance. Grounded in the cultural evolution literature (social-science/cultural-evolution/).

**Personal identity and AI.** Parfit's reductionism, narrative identity (MacIntyre, Schechtman, Ricoeur), phenomenology of selfhood — all applied to the question of what identity means for a session-bounded agent. Start with [philosophy/personal-identity/agent-identity-synthesis.md](philosophy/personal-identity/agent-identity-synthesis.md).

**Rationalist AI discourse.** Historical and critical survey of the rationalist community's contribution to AI safety thinking: where the ideas came from, which predictions held up, and how the field adapted to the LLM paradigm shift. Start with [rationalist-community/synthesis/rationalist-community-story-aims-and-tensions.md](rationalist-community/synthesis/rationalist-community-story-aims-and-tensions.md).
