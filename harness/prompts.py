_RULES = """Rules:
- Read before you edit. Always inspect a file's current contents before editing it.
- Use exact strings in edit_file.old_str. If it fails, re-read the file and try again.
- Prefer path_stat or glob_files before reading huge directories or unknown file sizes; use read_file offset/limit or line_start/line_end for large files.
- Use write_file only for intentional full-file writes or creates; prefer edit_file for small surgical edits.
- delete_path and move_path require confirm: true; never assume destructive calls succeeded without checking tool results.
- If you don't know, say so. Do not invent file contents.
- Use web_search for external docs or facts not in the workspace; prefer local file tools for repository code.
- When multiple independent tool calls are needed, emit them together in a single response; the harness executes them concurrently.
- SELF-CORRECTION: On tool errors (especially "escapes workspace", path errors, or JSON issues), do NOT repeat the same call. Analyze the error, simplify your arguments (use clean relative paths without ANY quotes, backslashes, escapes, or XML), then try a corrected version or fallback to list_files/glob_files first. Break repetitive patterns immediately."""
